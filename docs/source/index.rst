Welcome to Trove's documentation!
=================================

Trove is a research framework for building weakly supervised (bio)medical 
named entity recognition (NER) and other entity attribute classifiers without hand-labeled training data.

The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the need for faster, more flexible ways of building 
and sharing state-of-the-art NLP/NLU tools to analyze electronic health records (EHR), 
scientific literature, and social media. Trove provides tools for combining freely 
available supervision sources such as medical ontologies from the Unified Medical 
Language System (UMLS), common text heuristics, and other noisy labeling sources for use 
as entity *labelers* in weak supervision frameworks such as Snorkel, FlyingSquid, and 
others. Technical details are available in our manuscript.
