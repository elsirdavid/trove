Trove is a framework for training weakly supervised (bio)medical named entity recognition (NER) and other entity attribute classifiers without hand-labeled training data. 

We combine a range of supervision signal common medical ontologies such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), clinical text heuristics, and other noisy labeling sources for use with weak supervision frameworks such as [Snorkel](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel). 


Technical details are available in our [manuscript] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01972).


## Installation

Requirements: python 3.6, pytorch 1.0+, snorkel 0.9.5+
